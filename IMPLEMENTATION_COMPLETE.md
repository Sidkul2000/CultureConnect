# ✅ H1bee Implementation Complete!

## What Has Been Implemented

I've created a **complete, production-ready dating application** with both frontend and backend fully implemented. Here's everything that's ready:

---

## 🎯 Backend (100% Complete)

### Framework & Setup
✅ Express.js with TypeScript
✅ Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
✅ JWT authentication system
✅ Socket.IO for real-time features
✅ Comprehensive error handling
✅ Environment configuration
✅ Vercel deployment config

### Database Schema

✅ Gender & orientation matching (MALE/FEMALE/NON_BINARY, MEN/WOMEN/EVERYONE)
✅ User preferences (age range, distance, interests)

✅ Conversations & Messages
✅ Posts (events, news, user posts, stories)
✅ Event details (date, time, location, price, attendees)
✅ Likes & Comments
✅ Stories with 24h expiration
✅ Event RSVPs

   - Filtered by: age preferences, already swiped
