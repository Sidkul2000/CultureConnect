# Pusher Migration Complete! üéâ

Your app has been successfully migrated from Socket.IO to Pusher. Pusher works perfectly with Vercel's serverless architecture!

## ‚úÖ What Was Changed

### Backend Changes:
1. **Installed Pusher** - Added `pusher` package for server-side real-time events
2. **Created Pusher Service** - New service at `backend/src/services/pusher.service.ts` to handle:
   - Match notifications
   - Typing indicators
   - New message notifications
3. **Updated Match Routes** - Modified `backend/src/routes/match.routes.ts` to trigger Pusher events instead of Socket.IO
4. **Added Pusher Auth Endpoint** - New route at `/api/pusher/auth` for private channel authentication
5. **Initialized Pusher in API** - Updated `api/index.ts` to initialize Pusher on startup

### Frontend Changes:
1. **Installed pusher-js** - Added Pusher client library
2. **Updated useSocket Hook** - Converted `shadcn-ui/src/hooks/useSocket.ts` to use Pusher (with backwards compatible exports)
3. **Updated NewDashboard** - Modified to use Pusher channels for real-time match notifications
4. **Updated Environment Variables** - Added Pusher configuration

## üîë Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)
```env
PUSHER_APP_ID="2064476"
PUSHER_KEY="62b7fbd2cf90d674ebaa"
PUSHER_SECRET="0eb6fcd6a7e758c82f25"
PUSHER_CLUSTER="us2"
```

### Frontend (.env)
```env
VITE_PUSHER_KEY="62b7fbd2cf90d674ebaa"
VITE_PUSHER_CLUSTER="us2"
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy to Vercel

Your backend is already configured for Vercel! Just push to your repository and Vercel will auto-deploy.

### 2. Set Environment Variables on Vercel

Go to your Vercel project settings ‚Üí Environment Variables and add:

**For Backend:**
```
PUSHER_APP_ID=2064476
PUSHER_KEY=62b7fbd2cf90d674ebaa
PUSHER_SECRET=0eb6fcd6a7e758c82f25
PUSHER_CLUSTER=us2
DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
FRONTEND_URL=https://<your-frontend-url>.vercel.app
```

**For Frontend:**
```
VITE_PUSHER_KEY=62b7fbd2cf90d674ebaa
VITE_PUSHER_CLUSTER=us2
VITE_API_URL=https://<your-backend-url>.vercel.app
```

### 3. Update CORS Settings

Make sure your backend's `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable matches your frontend's deployed URL.

## üß™ Testing Locally

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd shadcn-ui
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Real-Time Features:**
   - Create two user accounts
   - Have them swipe right on each other
   - You should see the match notification appear in real-time!

## üìä How It Works

### Match Notifications Flow:

1. User A swipes right on User B
2. Backend checks if User B already liked User A
3. If yes, it's a match!
4. Backend triggers Pusher event on User B's private channel: `private-user-{userId}`
5. User B's frontend (if online) receives the event instantly
6. Match modal appears for both users

### Private Channels:

Each user has a private channel: `private-user-{userId}`
- Only the authenticated user can subscribe to their own channel
- Authentication is handled via `/api/pusher/auth` endpoint
- Requires valid JWT token

## üéØ What's Next?

You can now add more real-time features:

1. **Typing Indicators** - Already scaffolded in `pusher.service.ts`
2. **New Message Notifications** - Already scaffolded
3. **Online/Offline Status** - Use Pusher presence channels
4. **Read Receipts** - Trigger events when messages are read

## üí∞ Pusher Free Tier

Your free Pusher account includes:
- 200,000 messages/day
- 100 concurrent connections
- Unlimited channels

Perfect for development and small-scale production!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Pusher not initialized" Error
- Make sure environment variables are set
- Check that `initializePusher()` is called in `api/index.ts`

### "403 Forbidden" on channel subscription
- Check that the auth endpoint is working
- Verify JWT token is valid and not expired
- Make sure user is trying to subscribe to their own channel

### No real-time notifications
- Open browser console and check for Pusher connection
- Verify Pusher credentials are correct
- Check that the channel name matches: `private-user-{userId}`
